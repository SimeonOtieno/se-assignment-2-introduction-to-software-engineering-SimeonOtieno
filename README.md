Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: 

It's the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality softwear systems. 

It differs from Traditional Programming in that it involves a broader scope of activities beyond just writing code. The broader scope of activities include designing, testing, management and maintenance

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

i. Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
ii. Design - creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
iii. Implementations - writing code and building the softwear according to the design specifications.
iv. Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the softwear meets quality standards and functional requirements.
v. Deployment - releasing the softwear to the users or customers.
vi. Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

i. Both are software development methodologies which guide the software development process.
ii. Agile is the iterative and increamental approach focused on flexible collaboration and responding to change, while Waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases e.g reqirements, design, implementations, testing, deployment and maintenance flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile is preferred in dynamic environments with changing requirements, while Waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and where changes are not expected.
Agile is therefore preferred for long term projects, while Waterfall is preferred for short term projects.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering involves the gathering, analysing, documenting, managing and maintaining the software requirements throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.
It is crucial as it ensures the system meets the needs of users and stakeholders throughout the Life Cycle.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to designing softwear in seperate, interchageable components or modules.
It improves maintainability by allowing individual modules to be updated without affecting the entire system; and scalability by enabling the system to grow by adding new modules.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

i. Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software.
ii. Integration testing - testing interactions between different components or sub-systems.
iii. System testing - testing the entire system as a whole.
iv. Acceptance testing - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Testing is crucial in Software Development in that it ia a critical part of quality assurance ensuring the software is reliable , meets user needs and requirements and is free from defects.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
VCSs are important in that they are Software engineering tools which enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools and automated testing capabilities.
Examples are Git and Subversion.
Git - a tool that tracks changes in your code
    - a virtual controlled system

Subversion - atomic commits
           - allow locking of files hence no changes can be made.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Roles and Responsibilities;
i. Ensuring timely delivery - keeps theproject on schedule.
ii. Cost control - manages budgets and prevents costs overruns.
iii. Quality assurance - ensures the final product meets the required standards.
iv. Resource management - identifies and mitigates risks.
v. Risk management - identifies and mitigates risks.
vi. Stakeholder satisfaction - ensures the needs and expectations of stakeholders are met.

Challenges
i. Changing and unclear requirements.
ii. poor resource allocation.
iii. Tight deadlines.
iv. Technical debt.
v. Poor communication.
vi. Risk management.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment to correct faults, improve performance and adapt to changing environment.

Types of Maintenance
i. Corrective maintenance - fixing known issues
ii. Adaptive maintenance - modifying the present software to work in a new environment.
iii. Perfective maintenance - enhanving functionality and performance.
iv. Preventive maintenanve - anticipating and preventing future problems.

Maintenance is essential because it ensures the software continues to function properly, remains secure and meets evoving user needs throughout its life cycle.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical issues
i. Data privacy - ensuring user data is collected and used ethically.
ii. Algorithm bias - preventing discrimination and bias in software algorithms.
iii. Intellectual property - respecting copyrights and licenses.
iv. Transparency - on how software systems work and and their potential impact on users and society at large.
v. Security - building software with robust security measures to protect it against cyber threats and breaches.

Adherence to ethical issues
i. Follow strictly the Code of Ethics set by proffessional organizations like ACM or IEEE.
ii. Considering the interests of stakeholders affected by the software.
iii. Conducting regular ethical reviews of software projects.
iv. Consulting experts when facing complex ethical dilemmas.
